# Simple CRUD demo app made with aiohttp

The file [app.py](app.py) contains a basic usage example of *aiohttp*: A simple
data storage which allows to create, read, update, and delete JSON documents.

In [app-with-decorators.py](app-with-decorators.py) there is an equivalent example which uses
decorators to register the routes. This might look more familiar to those
who have experience with Flask.

The Jupyter notebok [crud-app-demo.ipynb](crud-app-demo.ipynb) demonstrates
the usage of the app.
